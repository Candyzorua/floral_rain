# Floral Rain

A Mandarin word game for Android and iOS designed to help Mandarin learners grow their vocabulary and improve their pinyin in a fun way.

Players chain phrases containing different words with identical pinyin to score points alongside a ticking timer. Successfully submitting a phrase refreshes the timer. To make things exciting, longer phrases grant exponentially more points!
